Just need to make a simple Counter Application

## Description

There should be a Add counter button(CTA), when we click on that button it should add a new counter.
And the counter should have a start/stop/delete button.


* Start Button will start the counter

* Stop Button will stop the counter

* Delete Button will delete the counter


## Note
```
You need to use setInterval for the counters

```
We can add Multiple counter by clicking on Add Counter Button (Max 4 counter can be added)

```
All counters should work individually
